From command line
1. compile 
mvn clean install
2. run
mvn jetty:run

just the component
http://localhost:8080/helloWorld/basic0X.cmp
run the test
http://localhost:8080/helloWorld/basic0X.cmp?aura.mode=JSTEST
X = 1,2,3

note:
we need the latest aura jars with Gerald's fix to get aura.mode=JSTEST to work -- that's what 0.1065-SNAPSHOT in pom.xml is. 
before that fix get into the public aura repository, pull and build aura with my branch : https://github.com/lhong375/aura.git
